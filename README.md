# boot_multipart
Figure out Spring Boot Multipart Support

This project is loosely based on Spring's "Getting Started - Uploading Files" tutorial:  https://spring.io/guides/gs/uploading-files/

## Running

To build Tenderfoot from scratch:

```
./gradlew clean build --info
```

That will generate a JAR file in the `build/libs` directory that can be run using:

```
java -jar build/libs/boot_multipart-*.jar
```
